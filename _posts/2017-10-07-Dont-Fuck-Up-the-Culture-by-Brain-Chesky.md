There is original link of post - [Donâ€™t Fuck Up the Culture](https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4)

This title was actually came from Peter Thiel's suggestion, when Brain Chesky asked for single most important piece of advice.

> The thing that will endure for 100 years, the way it has for most 100 year companies, is the culture. The culture is what creates the foundation for all future innovation.

> The stronger the culture, the less corporate process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing.

> In organizations (or even in a society) where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rule and processes.
