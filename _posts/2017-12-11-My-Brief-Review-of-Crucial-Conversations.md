This post is my brief review of [Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822).

However, I don't finish this book yet. But I think this book is really interesting and worth to be recommended.

We may question what is **crucial conversations**? There is the definition of crucial conversations from this book.

Basically, this book teaches you how to deal with those situations. What’s interesting to me is the content of this book related to the basic brain science, dialogue, self, metacognition, emotional intelligence, people development…etc. All of that knowledge is really critical when we are interacting with people which includes ourselves.

After I finish this book, I definitely take notes from this book. By the way, if you're interested in **Emotional Intelligence**, I had [study notes](https://jiminhsieh.github.io/2017/12/08/Emotional-Intelligence-From-Theory-to-Everyday-Practice) discussed this.
