> People just aren't very good at looking into their future and predicting correctly their emotional reactions to the events that might unfold.

> When I (people) think about the future, I also don't consider the fact that I'm going to be a different person in the future.

> Why did we make that mistake of thinking the two alternatives were so close when, in fact, they were really far apart? The answer is they weren't really close, and they weren't really far apart. It's just a matter of how you kook at it.

> We often fail to take into account all the little details that will actually make use happy or sad.

> We also don't fully appreciate that we might not quire be the same people we are then that we are now.

> We don't know who we will be when we are experiencing that event.

> One other idea that you and others have found is that uncertainty can amplify the emotional potency of events, that happy surprise and unhappy surprises make a bigger impact on use than happy things that we know are going to happen and sad things that we know are going to happen.
