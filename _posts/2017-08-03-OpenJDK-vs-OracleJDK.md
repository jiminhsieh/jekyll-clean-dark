Normally, I would like to use OpenJDK instead of OracleJDK. The reason that I suggest to use OpenJDK is easier to install and update for system engineer. You don't need to click the ***Accept License Agreement***. I know a lot of people think OracleJDK will beat OpenJDK in performance aspect. It may be true in JDK 6. But there is a [report](https://www.slideshare.net/AzulSystems/is-oracle-hotspot-better-than-azul-zulu) from Azul System that there is no huge difference in their benchmark. Basically, they tested Azul zulu 8 against OracleJDK 8. Azul zulu is just a certified build of OpenJDK. By the way, Azul zulu can run on major platforms - [Win](http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-windows/), [Linux](http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-linux/), [macOS](http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-mac/).
