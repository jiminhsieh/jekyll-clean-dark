> If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is already perfect.

## Good design is simple

> Beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament.

## Good design is timeless

> If you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations.

## Good design solves the right problem

## Good design is suggestive

> In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it how you want.

> You should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish.

## Good design is hard

> You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail.

## Good design looks easy

> You have to get them in exactly the right place. The slightest error will make the whole thing collapse.

## Good design uses symmetry

> There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.

> The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for thought.

## Good design is redesign

> They (experts) play for plans to change.

> Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix.

## Good design can copy

> Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.

> The greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. They just want to get the right answer.

## Good design happens in chunks

> Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems.
