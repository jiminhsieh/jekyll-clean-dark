# Good organizations

> People can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally.

> Every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective and make a difference both for the organization and themselves.

# Poor organizations

> People spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting and broken processes. They are not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are getting the job done or not.

# Reasons to be a good company

* Being a good company doesnâ€™t matter when things go well, but it can be the difference between life and death when things go wrong.
* Things always go wrong.
* Being a good company is itself an end.
