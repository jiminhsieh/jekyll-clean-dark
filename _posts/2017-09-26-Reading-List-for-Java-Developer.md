Although I am not finish all of books. But those books or materials are I think worth to read. 

* Books 
    * [Effective Java, 2nd](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/) by Joshua Bloch
        * I think every companies should give it to their Java developers. Even in Java 8, I thought it still work for most of part. However, it would publish [3rd edition]() this year. You could wait for it. Although, I could not wait for it, I hope it could release as soon as possible.   
    * [Java Generics and Collection](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527754.do)
        * It explains different Collections in depth and teach you how to use those Collections. It also teaches you the Generics. To have good design in Java, it would be essential to familiar with Generic.
    * [Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601)
        * In modern software, we need to deal lots of concurrent situations, I thought this book would let you know how JVM handle threads in detailed.
    * Core Java Volume [I](https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304) & [II](https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-II-Advanced-Features-10th/dp/0134177290)
        * This is one of the best books I would recommend to newcomer even you have some experiences, because it walk thought every part of Java platform. For experienced Java developers, I thought it still worth to revisit.  
    * [Java 8 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/java-8-in-action)
        * This is the best book I could think about. You would know how to work with new features in Java 8. For example, new date time api, CompletableFuture, lambda...etc. It's even teach you how to think functionally.
* Talks
    * [How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh4OeB9A-c)
        * [slides](www.cs.bc.edu/~muller/teaching/cs102/s06/lib/pdf/api-design)
