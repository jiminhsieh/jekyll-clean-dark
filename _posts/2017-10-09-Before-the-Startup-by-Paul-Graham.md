> Just pick people the way you would pick people if you were picking friends. (in business)

> Work with people you would generally like and respect and that you have known long enough to be sure about because there are a lot of people who are really good at seeming likable for a while.

> What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in your own users.

> If you measure people's performance they will inevitably exploit the difference to the degree that what you're measuring is largely an artifact of the fakeness.

> Whenever you hear somebody talk about Growth Hacks, just mentally translate it in your mind to "bullshit".

> If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree that you cannot imagine and if it succeeds it will take over your life for a long time.

> Which has this strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone who has done it.

> Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids; it's like a button you press and it changes your life irrevocably.

> you can't learn those until you actually start the company, which means that starting a startup is something you can intrinsically only learn by doing it.

> Starting a startup could be a good component of a good life for a lot of ambitious people. **This is just a part of a much bigger problem that you are trying to solve**.

> There are things that you can do in your early twenties that you cannot do as well before or after.

> But success has taken a lot of the serendipity out of his (Mark Zuckerberg) life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running Facebook.

> It's easy to tell how smart people are in ten minutes. Hit a few tennis balls over the net, and do they hit them back at you or into the net? **The hard part and the most important part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become**.

> The very best ideas almost always have to start as side projects because they're always such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.

> How do your turn your mind into the kind that has startup ideas unconsciously?
> 1. Learn about a lot of things that matter.
> 2. Work on problems that interest you.
> 3. Three, with people you like and or respect.

> I figured out a technique for detecting whether you have a taste for generally interesting problems. Which is whether you find working on boring things intolerable and there are known boring things.
