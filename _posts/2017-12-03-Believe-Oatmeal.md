There is the original link of comics - [http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe)

There is my comment for this comic. "How can you not love this comic? It have an important reminder of human's deficit with the funny comic."

> The same part of the brain that responds to a PHYSICAL threat responds to an INTELLECTUAL one. This area of the brain is known as the amygdala.

> Just remember that your worldview isn't a perfect house that use built to last forever. It's a cheap condo, and over time most of it will turn to shit.

> The mind can't separate the emotional cortex from the logical one. And one could argue that this emotional underbelly is what makes us human. **But I would argue that it's also what makes us animals.**

> I let the emotional cortex fight its little fight. And then I listen. And then I change.
