There is original link of essay - [http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html).

> One is that being mean makes you stupid.

> You never do your best work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.

> You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas by by thinking of tricks that work in one particular case.

> Mean founders lose is that they can't get the best people to work for them.
