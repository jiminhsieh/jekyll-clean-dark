There is the original transcript - [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).

> I have to get your to drop modesty and say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do first class work." 

> You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, "Yes I would like to do something significant."

> Luck favors the prepared mind.

> Great work is something else than mere brains.

> One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage.

> They (great scientists) think and continue to think.

> People are often most productive when working conditions are bad.

> The great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset.

> You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years."

> Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.

> The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.

> Just hard word is not enough - it much be applied sensibly.

> Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well.

> They doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory.

> If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started.

> Most great scientist are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it.

> So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem.

> He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.
