In my early career, I worked with embedded system. Although, most of the time I only handled userland of Linux. But no matter we work with user space or kernel space, you have to be proficient with C programming language. We definitely need some books to gain deep knowledge of C.

There are books I suggest you could consider:

* [C Programming Language, 2nd](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)

* [C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504)

* [Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298)
