There is original link of essay - [http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html).

> In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.

> Great hackers think of it(programming) as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.

> Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.

> A programming language is a medium of expression.

> Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.

> Hackers like to work for people with high standards. But it's not enough just to be exacting. You have to insist on the right things.

> If you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.

> The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.

> When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have in common is the extreme difficulty of making them work on anything they don't want to.

> Hackers are particularly curious, especially about how things work.
