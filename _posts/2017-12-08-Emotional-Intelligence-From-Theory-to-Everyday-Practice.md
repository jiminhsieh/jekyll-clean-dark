There is the original link of youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8JMWtwdLQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8JMWtwdLQ4).

This was a really interesting and fun talk. Although, I wrote down some of the important notes. There were still lots of his speechs are really meaningful, but it's too long to write down. I strongly suggest anyone should try to look at it.

In this talk, Marc Brackett, Ph.D. in Psychology and the Director of the [Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence](http://ei.yale.edu/), told about 5 important skills to train the Emotional Intelligence - RULER.

There are some of notes I took:

> From our perspective from an emotionally intelligent perspective, **all emotions are valid and important**, **it's what you do with them** (emotions).

> That red (High Energy and Low Pleasantness) is useful if you're dysregulated and nasty not useful **if you convert it (red) to passion now you have a difference**.

There is the original quadrant:

> Asking people like how good you are regulating your emotions and things of that sort just doesn't have any validity.

> Think about some of our most creative people are the artists of our generation. That sadness is what inspired them to develop their products.

I don't know why but this just remains me that Stewart Butterfield, founder of Slack and Flick, said "*[It's really easy for me to see things that are **frustrating**. I complain about stuff a lot, especially given how good my life is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsBjAuexPq4)*"

> We now have a study that shows that people who are more creative just biologically, who are more open to experience only are rated, in terms of their products, as being creative when they're high in emotional intelligence.

> When you're creative and you're trying things that you're going to fail a lot you're going to have disappointment a lot. And unless you have those strategies (RULER) to manage those disappointments that creates potential just will not be unleashed.


Last but not least, Marc Brackett also told about one quote from Aristotle I think it's really worth to write down.
